# Exoplanet Analysis Practice

This notebook performs data analysis on exoplanets and their attributes. The dataset used in this analysis is provided by Caltech.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about exoplanets, including their characteristics, such as mass, radius, and orbital period. It also includes other attributes, such as the host star's properties and the discovery method.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into the notebook for further analysis.

2. Data Cleaning: Any missing values or inconsistencies in the dataset are addressed and cleaned.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Various visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to gain insights into the dataset.

4. Feature Engineering: Additional features are created or existing features are transformed to enhance the analysis.

5. Modeling: Machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict certain attributes or classify exoplanets.

6. Results and Conclusion: The findings from the analysis are summarized, and conclusions are drawn based on the results.
